# Programming 4 Assignment - Minigin Engine

This project is part of the **Programming 4** course at Digital Arts & Entertainment (Howest).

## Implementation Details

Scene Graph, Dirty Flag, Component System, Game loop and more are all going to be implemented in this project.

Minigin is a very small project using [SDL3](https://www.libsdl.org/) and [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) for 2D c++ game projects. It is in no way a game engine, only a barebone start project where everything sdl related has been set up.

## Goal

The goal of this assignment is to use Minigin as a start project for the exam assignment in the course [Programming 4](https://youtu.be/j96Oh6vzhmg) at DAE. In this assignment we will need to recreate a 80's arcade game with a game engine programed by us. During the course we discuss several game programming patterns, using the book '[Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/)' by [Robert Nystrom](https://github.com/munificent) as reading material.
